Net::DNS::Native - non-blocking system DNS resolver

DESCRIPTION

This class provides several methods for host name resolution. It is
designed to be used with event loops. All resolving are done by
getaddrinfo(3) implemented in your system library. Since getaddrinfo()
is blocking function and we don't want to block, call to this function
will be done in separate thread. This class uses system native threads
and not perl threads. So overhead shouldn't be too big.
